Both are attachment disorders typically affecting children who have experienced neglect, abuse, or severe disruptions in caregiving during their formative years. While these disorders share some common causes and symptoms, they manifest in distinct behavioral patterns. In this article, we will delve into the definitions, symptoms, causes, and treatments for both disorders, comparing their similarities and differences, and exploring how they might relate to the real-life case of David Berkowitz, the infamous "Son of Sam."</span>

It was officially introduced in the DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition) in 2013. DSED primarily affects children who have undergone significant neglect, abuse, or disruptions in caregiving early in life. The hallmark symptom of DSED is the child's overly familiar behavior with strangers, often displayed in ways that are developmentally inappropriate. Children with DSED may approach and interact with unfamiliar adults without fear, hesitation, or regard for social boundaries.</span>

One of the victims, identified as Michelle Forman, survived the attack, but the identity of the other woman remains largely unknown. According to Berkowitz, the motivation behind the assault was not personal or out of any known grievance; instead, he claimed that he was driven by demons. Berkowitz later described how he felt an overpowering urge to commit the violent act, which he believed was influenced by some form of supernatural or demonic force. He would later use similar justifications for his more <a goto="https://www.alcatrazeast.com/crime-library/serial-killers/david-berkowitz-son-sam-killer/#text-8" class="cursor-pointer text-brown-light hover:text-brown-accent">notorious and deadly spree of shootings in the years that followed.</a></span>

On August 10th, they conducted a search of his car and discovered a number of incriminating items, including a rifle, ammunition, detailed maps of the crime scenes, and an unsent letter from the infamous "Son of Sam" taunting the police. The letter read: "Police - Let me haunt you with these words: I'll be back! I'll be back!" When Berkowitz was apprehended, he was found holding his .44 caliber Bulldog revolver, the weapon used in the shootings. His arrest brought an end to the reign of terror that had shocked New York City for over a year. </span>

According to Berkowitz, the demon was speaking to him through a neighbor's dog, owned by a man named Sam Carr, and it was the dog that commanded him to commit the violent acts. Psychologically, Berkowitz was described as neurotic and possibly suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, with a deep belief in his delusions of demonic possession. His bizarre behavior and justifications for the murders became central to the investigation and his later trials.</span>

In truth, the real motivation behind his killings stemmed from deep-rooted anger and feelings of rejection, particularly toward women. Berkowitz confessed that he targeted young women, especially those with long hair, a pattern that may have reflected his <a goto="#trauma" class="cursor-pointer text-brown-light hover:text-brown-accent">own unresolved childhood trauma</a>. His choice of victims likely symbolized his intense frustration and bitterness toward women, stemming from a sense of personal rejection and alienation from society.

                                        <span class="mt-2">David Berkowitz's life and crimes represent an extreme example of how disturbed emotional attachments, early trauma, and untreated psychological disorders can lead to violent behavior. His experiences with RAD, DSED, and antisocial personality disorder likely contributed to his detachment from others and his inability to form healthy relationships. While his violent acts cannot be excused, understanding his troubled past helps to explain the deep emotional distress and feelings of rejection that fueled his path toward criminality. Berkowitz's life serves as a tragic reminder of how early neglect and psychological damage can shape a person's worldview, and in his case, lead to unimaginable acts of violence. Although we should not empathize with his crimes, we can empathize with the suffering he endured during his formative years, which ultimately shaped his twisted path toward becoming one of the most infamous criminals in American history.</span>

                                                    <span>What fascinates me the most is the profound impact that childhood experiences have on our entire lives. Imagine growing up in an ideal environment with a loving, supportive family that nurtures your emotional, physical, and mental well-being. With such a foundation, the likelihood of leading a long, healthy, and relatively trouble free life is much higher. Now, contrast that with someone who grows up in a neglectful or abusive environment. A child raised in a family that is not there for them, emotionally or physically, is at a high risk of developing disorders like DSED, RAD, ASPD (Antisocial Personality Disorder), or even engaging in behaviors like larceny or pyromania as coping mechanisms. These early childhood experiences can leave lasting scars, as we see in the case of David Berkowitz, whose story shows the powerful impact of neglect. This connects with the early life trauma theories, showing how neglect and abuse in childhood can shape adult behavior and even lead to criminal acts.</span>

                                                    <span>Serial killers are not simply born with an inherent desire to kill. Contrary to what many might think, there is always a deeper reason behind their actions, a complex set of factors that shape their motives. This suggests that when a serial killer claims they killed "just because", it's likely a cover for something deeper and more personal. There is a reason, and often that reason traces back to neglect and early trauma. Looking at individuals like David Berkowitz, we can see how his early neglect created a psychological profile that eventually led to violence. His story shows the connection between DSED, RAD, and other behavioral disorders in those who suffer from early childhood trauma. This is not an excuse for the violence, but it provides a basis for understanding how neglected children can develop these destructive behaviors as they grow older.</span>

                                                    <span>Preventing such tragedies is simpler than many might think, yet it's deeply unfortunate that they continue to occur. The key to prevention lies in one fundamental action: being a caring parent. Neglect can arise from various circumstances, but the most damaging type of neglect comes from the parents themselves; the very people who are supposed to provide support, guidance, and love. When parents neglect their children, whether intentionally or not, they send a clear message: "Figure it out on your own." But children are not capable of navigating the complexities of life without support. When they're left to fend for themselves, they often resort to unhealthy coping mechanisms to fill the void; mechanisms that could range from minor misbehaviors to more destructive actions, like larceny or pyromania. Take the case of David Berkowitz, his neglected childhood led him to seek ways to cope, resulting in criminal behaviors like stealing and setting fires. This is not something a child should be forced into, yet it became his way of surviving in a world that failed him. The lesson here is clear: neglecting a child can have devastating consequences, not just in childhood, but throughout their life.</span>

                                        <span class="mt-2">David Berkowitz's life serves as a tale of how neglect in childhood can spiral into destructive behavior in adulthood. As a society, we must recognize the importance of being attentive, supportive parents to our children. If we treat our children with the same neglect that Berkowitz experienced, we may be setting them on a dangerous path. So, if you're a parent, take a moment to reflect on how you're treating your child. Ask yourself: Are you giving them the love and attention they need? Are you neglecting them, either emotionally or physically? Because, as Berkowitz's story shows, the consequences of neglect can be devastating, and in some cases, lead to horrific outcomes.</span>
