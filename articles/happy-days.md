# Hello! This is the first article on the website.
This article is mainly going to go over what these articles will usually contain. It's not some professional article website where the sources are checked 10-fold, it's more of a **small place you can find small answers, to problems that seem irrelevant until it actually happens.** I've had many problems I have had to fix with no real fix, the solution took hours, when the coding took minutes. This articles side of the website is exactly for that. **Answers to small problems.**

```js
// What the... ðŸ¤¯
function init() {
  console.log("Hello world!");
}
```

I hope you find help in these articles, they will only exists for solutions to my problems, so I hope at least one fixes something you are stuck on.

# Other things
I may have said it to harshly, but not **all the articles** are going to be code related, some might be experiences about something, like my resume. Some of you probably got no clue how a resume works, or how it is written. I'm still learning about this, eventually I will get it, and I will post my findings in an article here.

In other words, seriously this time. I hope you find help here. Thanks for reading.
