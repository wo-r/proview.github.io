            <h1 class="font-black color-primary text-6xl md:text-8xl leading-normal tracking-tight">Welcome!</h1>
            <span>Hello! Thanks for taking a look at my personal website! I have spent quite some time building it, and I wanted the website to be a place where I can share my thoughts and create my resume for future endeavors. I love to code; I spend almost every day trying to make something, either to fix, implement, or just for some fun. It's genuinely the best thing to ever exist on this planet, and I don't think I could really live without it.</span>
            <h2 class="font-black color-primary text-4xl md:text-5xl leading-normal tracking-tight mt-10">What is the purpose of this website?</h2>
            <span>This website was created to serve multiple purposes: to share my resume, to write articles about my experiences, and to offer help through my articles to others who are in the same situation I was in. That's about it, and I'm proud that it is like that.</span>
            <h2 class="font-black color-primary text-4xl md:text-5xl leading-normal tracking-tight mt-10">How it started</h2>
            <div class="flex flex-col gap-5">
                <span>About 4 years ago from today <b class="font-black color-accent">(03/08/2024)</b>, I grew very tired of school's attempts to block access to websites or specific YouTube videos. I rebelled against this, perhaps a little too much. Some of my rebellious attempts worked, while others didn't. It was during this time that I learned about HTML and the ability to create websites. My journey began with a website template creator called <b class="font-black color-accent">Nicepage</b>, which was okay, but I found it difficult to operate. I only managed to create one website with it, and it was not very good.</span>
                <span>Later that year, I started creating Python scripts, one of which was called <b class="font-black color-accent">Folder Manager</b>, used for managing folders and directories. This was when my love for coding truly sparked. As a freshman in high school, I began coding websites with true HTML from the heart. After some time, I wanted to create a real website, one with a domain. I discovered a free website hosting service called <b class="font-black color-accent">000webhost</b>, where I also learned <b class="font-black color-accent">PHP</b>, another amazing language that I love to use. It was during this time that projects like <b class="font-black color-accent">Vote-Ralph</b>, <b class="font-black color-accent">Soldier-Island-Display</b>, <b class="font-black color-accent">Chrome-Crash</b>, and <b class="font-black color-accent">Read180-Bypass</b> were created on GitHub.</span>
                <span>Afterwards, I learned about jQuery, which remains my best-known language to this day. I began to have some far-fetched but not impossible ideas. One of the most persistent ideas was for our school's website <b class="font-black color-accent">Echo, by Agilix</b>, which, to me, was badly designed and could be greatly improved. This led to my involvement with <b class="font-black color-accent">Themius</b>, <b class="font-black color-accent">CustomSkins</b>, and now <b class="font-black color-accent">Proview</b>.</span>
                <span>Throughout my sophomore and junior years, I continued this work whenever I had time, and it has really paid off, as I now use it daily. I could not imagine my school life without it. So, all of this brings us to now. I am an intermediate coder, self-taught, persistent at something that may never work, and still in high school. Why am I the way I am? Who knows, but I absolutely love it.</span>

            <h2 class="font-black color-primary text-5xl md:text-6xl leading-normal tracking-tight mt-10">What is my plan?</h2>
            <span>Quite simple, <b class="font-black color-accent">graduate from high school</b>, <b class="font-black color-accent">earn a degree in Computer Science from college</b>, and then either secure a job or start my own business, where I can develop games or create websites.</span>
